If user chooses to sign up, `Sign Up Window` is displayed. Here user must fill the signing up form, with respect to the following rules (username != passoword, password != repeatPassword, cnpLenght = 13). After signing up user can press the **Back to login** button and login with the newly created credentials.

If username **admin** and password **specialAdminPassword** are provided, user is redirected to the `Admin Window`. In this page admin can see all users data, see specific user betting summarry / transaction and ban / unban specific user. *Banned* user won't login until the *Unban* action is taken.

If normal user is logged in, `Roulette Window` opens. Here user must select a stake sum (5, 10, 25, 50 or MAX BET), place a bet (number, color, dozen, parity, 1-18/19-36) and see the result by pressing the "Spin the wheel" button. Top right placed balance label is updating with result and every bet placed. Top left placed time label shows the current time and updates every second.

By pressing Transactions button, `Transaction Window` opens. User's available cards are displayed in the top down list view. An operation (Add new card, Deposit, Withdraw) must be selected. If user wants to add a new card, he must add a 16 digit card number that don't exist in the database. After introducing a new card, it will have a random generated available sum (<600). The funds can be deposited after choosing deposit action. If user wants to withdraw money, he must introduce credentials of a specific card and make sure requested sum <= balance.

## Establish Database Connection:
To add database in your downloaded project, follow the steps described below.
First, ensure you have MySQL and the JDBC driver installed to initialize the connection between the project and the database. If you haven't installed these yet, this tutorial could be very helpful: [MySQL & JDBC Installation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8g9eNnFpHQ&t=194s).

After confirming that MySQL and JDBC are installed on your computer, open **MySQL WORKBENCH**. On the homepage

![MySQL Workbench Homepage Image](https://github.com/todoor17/RouletteApp/assets/152257565/10e7f186-921f-410e-abb9-bca707fac0e9)

You will see your username (**root** in this example) and the port number your local MySQL server is running on (**3306**) â€” note that your details may differ. Click on 'Local instance MySQL80', enter your password, and log in. On the left side of the page, you will see your schemas. Navigate to **toolbar -> server -> Data import**.

Select 'Import from Dump Project Folder' and choose the folder where you have downloaded the project files. The 'bettingdatabase' object should appear in the selection list.

If everything works fine, create a new 'bettingdatabase' schema, select all tables, and click on **START IMPORT**. Now, open the project folder in IntelliJ, search for the `DBConnector` class, and complete the code with **YOUR_PORT_NUMBER**, **YOUR_USERNAME**, and **YOUR_PASSWORD**.
